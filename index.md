# Introduction

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> The Toxicological Prioritization Index (ToxPi) is a framework used to integrate diverse data from multiple sources to create a visual and numerical ranking of chemicals or other entities. The ToxPi framework is particularly useful in toxicology for assessing potential risks based on multiple lines of evidence, but its flexible design allows it to be applied to other complex datasets, including geospatial and public health data.

# Software

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> ToxPi is available in the following software distributions that are under active development.

## toxpiR

- GitHub for toxpiR package (includes branches under active development with new features): [toxpiR GitHub](https://github.com/ToxPi/toxpiR)

- CRAN version of toxpiR package (stable release): [toxpiR on CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=toxpiR)
